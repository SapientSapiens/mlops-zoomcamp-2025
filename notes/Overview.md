# What to Expect from the Zoomcamp #

 The MLOps Zoomcamp is a comprehensive 9-week program designed to equip you with the skills and tools necessary to take machine learning models from development to production. Here's a week-by-week overview. DataTalksClub’s MLOpsZoomcamp is structured to take you from “first commit” to “fully automated pipeline” in a few core modules:

 ## 1. Introduction to MLOps ##

  - Understanding the importance of MLOps in the ML lifecycle

  - Overview of the course structure and objectives

  - Introduction to the New York City Taxi dataset, which will be used throughout the course

  - Setting up the development environment

 ## 2. Experiment Tracking and Model Management ##

  - Introduction to experiment tracking concepts

  - Hands-on with MLflow for tracking experiments

  - Saving and loading machine learning models

  - Understanding and utilizing model registries

  - Practical exercises to reinforce learning

 ## 3. Workflow Orchestration ##

  - Understanding the need for orchestration in ML workflows

  - Introduction to orchestration tools and concepts

  - Building and managing ML pipelines

  - Homework assignments to apply orchestration techniques

 ## 4. Model Deployment ##

  - Exploring different deployment strategies: online (web, streaming) vs. offline (batch)

  - Deploying models using Flask for web services

  - Implementing streaming deployments with AWS Kinesis and Lambda

  - Setting up batch scoring for offline processing

  - Assignments to practice deployment methods

 ## 5. Model Monitoring ##

  - Understanding the importance of monitoring in ML services

  - Setting up the environment, preparing reference and model

  - Implementing monitoring with Evidently, and Grafana

  - Dummy monitoring and data quality monitoring

  - Homework to apply monitoring techniques

 ## 6. Best Practices in MLOps ##

  - Implementing unit and integration testing for ML code

  - Utilizing linting, formatting tools, and pre-commit hooks
  
  - Testing cloud services with LocalStack

  - Makefiles and make

  - Git pre-commit hooks

  - Setting up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions

  - Introduction to Infrastructure as Code using Terraform

  - Assignments to practice best practices in MLOps


 Throughout the course, we'll engage in hands-on workshops and assignments that reinforce each module's concepts. By the end of the program, we'll have a solid understanding of how to manage the entire ML lifecycle, from development to production.
